## NAME: upgrade-ha-major.yml
#
## DESCRIPTION:
# Playbook will perform a major version upgrade (example: 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5) on a PAN-OS HA pair.  
# This playbook simply imports the other playbooks kept in the same repository making up the parts of this process 
# (content upgrade, download base image, install target version).
#
# This playbook requires connection details for the two members of the HA pair to be specified in the variables 
# 'primary_ip_address', 'secondary_ip_address', 'username', and 'password'.  These may be defined as host variables
# (example: host_vars/ha_pair.yaml) or extra vars.
#
## USAGE:
# Required variables:
## Target HA pair.  See: host_vars/ha_pair.yml for sample definition of host variables.
# Base_version: Base version downloaded to both members of the HA pair.  
# This version is not installed (for example, the 9.0.0 base image in the 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5 upgrade process).
# Target_version: Version of PAN-OS to ultimately install on both members of the HA pair 
# for example, 9.0.5 in the 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5 upgrade process).
# See the VARS section of the playbook for additional customization options.
#
## COMMAND TO RUN PLAYBOOK:
# ansible-playbook palo-upgrade-ha-major.yaml --extra-vars "target=ha_pair base_version=9.0.0 target_version=9.0.5"
#
# Notes
# HA pairs with preemption enabled are not supported by these playbooks.
